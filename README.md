# GitHub clone

- Technologies: Java, Spring, React and Typescript
- Deploy* on <https://web-github-clone.onrender.com>

*The application may require some time to render the first time (from one to two
minutes) due to server inactivity.

## Description

The system consists of a server and a web client. The server uses asynchronous
programming to simultaneously request multiple endpoints of GitHub API and
produce an aggregated result with reduced response time.

The output is consumed by the client to render a clone of GitHub interface,
adapted as a single-page application (SPA), specifically designed to search and
display user profiles and repositories.
